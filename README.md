Give any Web Application Security Scanner a run for its money

## What is corroborate
I created corroborate as a testing ground when I was looking to buy a Web Application Security Scanner to scan a number of public website for vulnerabilities. 

The core of Corroborate is a security-flawed web app. You can use Corroborate to test if the Web Application Security Scanner you're evaluating is any good.
